## Introduction

Convert geo-tagged photographs to a KML overlay suitable for import into Google Earth.

## Attribution Notice

Most of the code here is heavily derivate of Mano Mark's code samples posted on the [Keyhole Markup Language documentation](https://developers.google.com/kml/articles/geotagsimple) page but has been adapted for Python 3.X versions with a few enhancements. From what I can tell this code is not hosted anywhere (it was only provided as snippets) so this project replicates it from scratch rather than as a fork. All python files should be considered as modifications of these source snippets.
